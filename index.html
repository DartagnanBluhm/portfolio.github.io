                        <p>As an individual, I pride myself on being a reliable, independent, loyal person who is motivated to produce exceptional results. 
                            I enjoy experiences that allow me to learn and improve myself, especially in new environments as I work well under pressure and 
                            it allows me to analyse and reflect on how much I have and can continue to improve. I currently have experience working in both 
                            the back and front end of businesses such as retail and hospitality as well as minor experience in web development. After completing 
                            my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science, I am now aiming for a more fulfilling career in my chosen field. I am open-minded and love to 
                            discuss the differing opinions between people, as well as research topics to further my knowledge as an individual.</p>

                        <p>I am curious individual and love to analyse and understand how systems operate. This translates positively to my career, as my
                            interest fuels my desire to know more. I spend as much time as I can building my own projects, which can be viewed below.

                        <p>To date, I am currently a Junior Web Developer who is seeking to gain experience in the workforce to become a Full-Stack Developer.</p>

                        <p>In the future, I plan to learn more about Data Science and breach into that field of study. My interest in this field originates from 
                            completing my Bachelor of Computer Science, where I had one topic called 'Heuristic Optimisation' on Machine Learning. It just 
                            fascinated me that we could produce systems that could be so specialised and although biased, in some cases outperform a human. 
                            I am also interested in Neuromorphic Computing, however, feel as though this subject is too complex and out of reach for my present self.

                        <h2>10 Year plan</h2>
                        <p>For the next 5 years, I plan to gain experience in Full-Stack Web Developer and gain capital to develop my financial situation.
                            Then depending on my situation I would like to begin studying Data Science.</p>
