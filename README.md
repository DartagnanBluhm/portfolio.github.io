# portfolio.github.io
This project is intended to be a learning experience in web development, as well as to produce a portfolio, allowing easily expressions of my work via github. 
Additionally, I would like to implement this using PHP as the main framework, with CSS for styling. A table will be used to display all project, which will be either
hand written, or a web scraper will be implemented to pull information about the project from the given github link.
